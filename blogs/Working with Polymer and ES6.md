# Working with Polymer and ES6

Welcome. This article is aimed to help introduce you to the concepts of Polymer & ES6, how these two technologies
 can work together to achieve some awesome things, and lightly touch on some build and workflow tools to assist you in
 becoming more proficient.

If you are new to these topics, or would like a brief brush up, continue reading below. If you're seasoned in
 these, feel free to skip ahead to the action in [Getting Started](#getting-started)!

## Polymer
Google's' [Polymer Project](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) is a wonderful library helping to propel the adoption
of web components into your projects today! While the browsers work to support these natively, Polymer servers as tool
to help you build and create custom elements, but it is much more than a polyfill library.

> The Polymer library is designed to make it easier and faster for developers to create great, reusable components for
the modern web.

### Componentization

Working with Polymer, and getting the most out of it, first and foremost requires a healthy shift in the development
methodology. Gone are the days of unmaintainable monolithic applications and sites, an uncombatable level of
technical debt, and struggling to keep your tests and coverage manageable. Componentization as a methodology, a core
concept of Polymer, helps to isolate and specialize just about any of your front end/UX concerns, so that as your
project grows, there is always a level of sanity and focus kept in line.

As developers, we know full well what it's like to join a new established project, or return to one you worked on
months ago, and start to tiptoe through the mine field again until you're proficient.

### Learn Polymer

Here are some great resources of what Polymer offers if you're unfamiliar:
- [Polymer Project](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) - The official Polymer library web site with a ton of
documentation to help get you going and versed in the particulars.
- [Polymer Catalog](https://elements.polymer-project.org/) - An official collection of Polymer components to be
leveraged, and serve as practical examples of components in action.
- [WebComponents.org](http://webcomponents.org/) - A site dedicated to information, articles, and more on all things
web component related.

## ECMAScript 6 (ES6)
ES6, the next evolution of the Javascript language. If you haven't heard of it yet, clearly you've been living under a
rock, and it's fortunate you stumbled upon this article! It brings many new and improved concepts to JS world and
empowers developers to write cleaner native code that packs a punch.

From adding true class support, to improved variable scoping, native module support... there's no lack of amazing
and essential improvements to the language we **all** know and love (...well, most of us!). These are just a
few is the goodies waiting for you to make use of, but before you throw caution to the wind, there are some things to
 consider when taking on the task of diving into ES6.

### Transpiler

At present, browsers are still working to fully support ES6 natively, and while most modern browsers are getting very
 close to that point, older dated browsers (yup, as you guessed it, IE) aren't up to snuff with handling ES6s
 improvements. Fear not! While unlike a library like Polymer which can use simple polyfills to add support for wider
 cross browser support, ES6 must instead leverage a transpiler.  These tools allow you and your team to write all of
 the juice ES6 code you want, and it will covert (just about all of it) into fully functional ES5 code, which
 browsers are pleasantly happy to digest for you.

 [Babel JS](https://babeljs.io/) & [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) are the most prevalent ES6
  transpilers out there in the community.

When native support in browsers has standardized, and we can throw away those dusty old ones, the theory is that these
 transpilers will go away. At the time of writing this, the modern browsers are getting quite close to full support.
 [ES6 Compatibility Support](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)

While it's a possibility these could be phased out, from many tools like these which started by letting us use future
concepts sooner, they continue to push the edge of development given how slow language specification takes to change.
 Transpilers a buffer for writing native code today for the future, and once you've had a taste, you will understand
 why having them stick around isn't a bad thing whatsoever!

**Babel JS** https://babeljs.io/

Babel is the transpiler of choice used in this article. As well it is seemingly being the de facto transpiler of choice.

> By default, Babel ships with a set of ES2015 syntax transformers. These allow you to use new syntax, right now
without waiting for browser support.

Babel is very versatile whether you're leveraging it from the command line and from within your build and testing
tools, with detailed examples of how to accomplish this on their website.  Their site on the whole is actually quite
awesome, also providing you a full comprehensive summary of ES6 concepts, to experimental ES7 support (hell yes!),
and a sandbox for you to test code in.

### Learn ES6

Here are some great resources of what ES6 brings to the plate for you to peruse if you're unfamiliar:
- [Babel JS's ES2015 Guide](http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/#ecmascript-6-features) - A solid API reference to the
features and strait forward code samples for each.
- [Maciej Rzepi≈Ñski's' ES2015 Guides on Medium](https://medium.com/ecmascript-2015) - A detailed look at the different
topics in ES6, with code samples and comparisons to matching ES5 code.
- [Learn ES2015](http://learnharmony.org/#) - An interactive guide to learning and testing out the concepts.

*What's this ES2015 I keep seeing? I thought we were talking about ES6 here? O.o*

ES6 was officially agreed upon as a standard as of June 2015. The
[ECMAScript Language Specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) improvements were dubbed
ES2015 in lieu of this. Before ES6 it had been referenced as Harmony, but ES6 is still the widely adopted name, as
regardless of the extra labels, it is still ECMAScript 6 in the end.
