# Working with Polymer and ES6

Welcome. This multi-part article is aimed to help introduce you to the concepts of Polymer & ES6, how these two
technologies  can work together to achieve some awesome things, and lightly touch on some build and workflow tools to
assist you in becoming more proficient.

## [Part 1 - Introduction](https://github.com/hence-io/hence-component-framework/tree/master/blogs/working-with-polymer-and-es6/1-introduction)

In Part 1, we will be exploring what Polymer and ES6 are all about, and why working with them can be beneficial.

If you are new to these topics, or would like a brief brush up, it's highly recommend you start with reading here
from the beginning. If you're seasoned in those tools, you may still find some help tidbits, but feel free to skip
ahead to the action in Part 2!

## [Part 2 - Getting Started](https://github.com/hence-io/hence-component-framework/tree/master/blogs/working-with-polymer-and-es6/2-getting-started)

In Part 2, we will be getting a sample project set up for you to begin using Polymer and ES6 together, rendering your
first web component.

## [Part 3 - Exploring Components](https://github.com/hence-io/hence-component-framework/tree/master/blogs/working-with-polymer-and-es6/3-exporing-components)

In Part 3, we are diving in to our new component to explore the various aspects of Polymer to start crafting the
foundation of our component.

## [Part 4 - Enhancing Functionality](https://github.com/hence-io/hence-component-framework/tree/master/blogs/working-with-polymer-and-es6/4-enhancing-functionality)

In Part 4, we are now ready to start expanding and featurizing our new component to make it a practical component we
could see ourselves using in a site or web application.

## [Part 5 - Hence Framework and Stack](https://github.com/hence-io/hence-component-framework/tree/master/blogs/working-with-polymer-and-es6/5-hence-framework-and-stack)

In the conclusion of this article, we take a look at an improved way to develop and publish our component in a
specialized stack, and some methodology behind how to get the most out of the components you build.
