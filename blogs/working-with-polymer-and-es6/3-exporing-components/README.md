# Working with Polymer and ES6 - Exploring Components

In Part 3, we are now ready to start expanding and featurizing our new component to make it a practical component we
could see ourselves using in a site or web application.

## Component Bootcamp

With the sample project up and running, we can now start to explore what makes Polymer shine, while introducing you
to some of the great ES6 improvements to boot. If you haven't read through any of
[Polymer's Developer Guide](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview.html) yet, I highly
recommend it before continuing.

Here's the highlights of what we'll be covering:

- Component Life Cycle
- Properties
- Listeners
- Behaviours
- Styling
