## Hence

Hence is a shift in modern development methodology, focused intently on build web components at it's core utilizing
Google's Polymer with a code base built entirely in ES6 / ES2015.

Hence's aim is to provide you with a streamlined development & build processes today for the cutting edge technology
of tomorrow. Build smaller, build smarter!

Full documentation for the [Framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hence-component-framework) and
[Stack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slush-hence) can be found on [npmjs.org](http://npmjs.org). Below is an
introduction into the purpose and benefits of these tools in working with Polymer and ES6.

## Hence Component Framework

Hence Component Framework is built on top of Polymer, designed to provide some essential standards to
the types of components to be based off of, and other essential helpers and tools to build better components.

The Component Framework is built in ES6 to leverage the latest benefits of native javascript, providing a streamlined
way to create and utilize Polymer components, sanitizing them to make sure they're sound, and allow for easier
debugging as required.

## Hence Component Stack

Providing comprehensive scaffolding and build support, you can get up and running with some base line components
effortlessly. Leveraging the power of the HenceComp core, an empowering extensible layer on top of Polymer, provides
you with the specialized component type at your finger tips, including some much needed abilities not natively found
in Polymer.
