/**
 * ### Event Hooks
 * #### ```Hence.hook(target, prepareData)```
 *
 * Provides an easy accessible hook function for the component to leverage. With accepting a object parameter which
 * contains an action method, this will provide a bindable event in the component's template, and automatically call
 * that method, passing in the targeted data model from the event.
 *
 * Optionally, before the data is sent along to the original hook, you can process the data with anything related to
 * the current component before it is sent off to be acted upon.
 *
 * Ideal use of these hooks are inside of Ui components, triggering hooks back to Models, so the Ui can handle the
 * event and model digest, and serve the Model exactly the data it needs. Additional parameters returned, the model
 * and originating event are provided should the hook be used between multiple Uis.
 *
 * @param {Object} e The event object triggering this hook request
 * @param {Object} target The the intended target to hook into
 * @param {Function|Null} prepareData A callback to allow the model data to be formatted before being returned to the callee
 * @returns {Function} The event callback to allow the component to hook into too
