// # Event Hooks
//
// Provides an easy accessible hook function for the component to leverage. With accepting a object parameter which
// contains an action method, this will provide a bindable event in the component's template, and automatically call
// that method, passing in the targeted data model from the event.
//
// Optionally, before the data is sent along to the original hook, you can process the data with anything related to
// the current component before it is sent off to be acted upon.
//
// Ideal use of these hooks are inside of Ui components, triggering hooks back to Models, so the Ui can handle the
// event and model digest, and serve the Model exactly the data it needs. Additional parameters returned, the model
// and originating event are provided should the hook be used between multiple Uis.
